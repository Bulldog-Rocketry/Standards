# Javascript Guidelines

## Dependencies

-   Use `yarn` or `npm` to manage dependencies.
-   The `node_modules` directory should be ignored in the `.gitignore` file.
-   The `package.json` and/or `yarn.lock` file(s) should be included in the repository.

## Formatting

-   Use `Prettier` to format your code.

## Documentation

-   Use comments/JSdoc to document your code.

## Testing

-   Use a program like `Jest` to write and run tests for your code.
-   You can also measure coverage with `Jest` to see how well you have written your tests.
